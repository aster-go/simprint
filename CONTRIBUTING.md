# Contributing to Simprint

Thanks for considering a contribution to Simprint.

This repository is in an active open-source transition. We welcome bug reports, documentation improvements, CI and packaging fixes, frontend refinements, test coverage, and well-scoped product improvements.

## Before You Start

- Search existing issues and discussions before opening a new one.
- For larger changes, open an issue or discussion first so the direction can be aligned before implementation.
- Keep pull requests focused. Small, reviewable changes move faster than broad refactors.

## Development Setup

Windows 从零配置、桌面端启动和本地数据目录说明请先阅读 [开发配置文档](./docs/development-setup.zh-CN.md)。

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm` 9
- Rust toolchain
- Tauri system prerequisites for your platform

### Local Run

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
cp src-tauri/config.example.toml src-tauri/config.development.toml
cargo tauri dev --features development
```

If you only need frontend iteration, you can also use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Local Runtime and Data

The desktop application is local-first. Its business routes use the embedded SQLite layer in `src-tauri/crates/business`, and its environment runtime is embedded from `src-tauri/crates/runtime`. Starting the desktop application automatically initializes the local user, workspace, database, and runtime.

Do not configure a remote `base_url`, PostgreSQL, or Redis for normal desktop development. Features that use Tauri commands, workspace resources, browser kernels, the Local API, or MCP should be tested through the desktop application rather than against the standalone `server/` project.

The `server/` directory is retained from the earlier hosted architecture and is not part of the desktop application's default runtime path. Only start or modify it when your contribution explicitly targets that standalone component; keep such changes clearly separated from desktop work.

## Useful Commands

Run these from the repository root unless noted otherwise:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm rust:fmt:check
pnpm rust:check
```

If you changed build, packaging, or release-related code, also run:

```bash
node build.cjs
```

## Pull Request Expectations

- Describe what changed and why.
- Mention any user-facing behavior changes.
- Include validation steps you ran locally.
- Attach screenshots or recordings for UI changes when helpful.
- Avoid mixing unrelated refactors into the same PR.

If your change touches build, release, or workflow files, call that out explicitly in the PR description.

## Issues and Bug Reports

Good bug reports usually include:

- Operating system and environment details
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Clear reproduction steps
- Screenshots, logs, or error messages when available

## Scope and Collaboration

Current high-value contribution areas include:

- Reproducible bug reports and targeted bug fixes
- Build, packaging, and CI improvements
- Documentation and onboarding improvements
- Frontend UX polish and workflow consistency
- Tests, regression coverage, and release verification

The environment runtime is maintained in this repository under `src-tauri/crates/runtime`; the browser-kernel layer (`simprint-browser-kernel`) remains a separate component. Changes to environment lifecycle behavior should include tests in the embedded runtime crate whenever possible.

## Communication

- English and Chinese are both acceptable in issues and pull requests.
- If you want to contribute on a longer horizon, open an issue or discussion and briefly introduce the areas you want to help maintain.
